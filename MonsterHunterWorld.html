     Monster Hunter World is an action role playing game developed and published by Capcom. It is the fifth game
      in the series and is Capcom's best selling title with over 16 million copies sold. It was first released on
      Playstation 4 and Xbox One in january 2018 and on PC in august 2018. You play as a hunter and throughout the
      game you are given quests to slay or capture large monsters. As a hunter you have a variety of tools to work
      with such as traps to keep the monster in place to make it easier to damage or capture it. Hunters have 14
      different weapon types to choose from, some of which include a longsword, a lance, a greatsword, a hammer and
      more unconventional weapons such as a gunlance (it's a lance that can shoot shells), a hunting horn (a giant
      musical instrument to bash the monster with and playing tunes helps to buff your friends) and many more.
      You can choose to hunt monsters alone or with a party of up to 4 players. As you finish quests to hunt or
      capture monsters you will aquire materials from the monsters which you can bring to a smithy and craft
      weapons and armour out of the monsters parts. <br>
      
      Capcom released the massive paid expansion Iceborne In January
      of 2019 for consoles and in January 2020 for PC. The reason behind the delay between pc and console versions
      of the game is that the Monster Hunter team hadn't previously made any games on PC so they focused on getting
      the game release on console first and then making sure they got the PC version as good as possible. The
      Iceborne expansion much like the expansions for the other monster hunter games add around as much content
      as there is in the base game, roughly doubling the monster roster and adding in 2 big new locations to explore
      and a plethra of new armour and weapons to craft
